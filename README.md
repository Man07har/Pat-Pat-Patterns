# String-Pattern-Matcher-App
Comparison of Naive and Rabin Karp algorithms for string matching. The comparison is based on the time taken by both algorithms. Rabin Karp algorithm is demonstrated with a simulation
This project demonstrates a simplified text-based simulation of the Rabin-Karp string matching algorithm using Streamlit, a Python library for creating web-based data applications.

## Overview

The project provides a Streamlit web application with two main options: "Run" and "Simulation."

- **Run**: Allows you to run the algorithm (you can implement your specific logic here).
- **Simulation**: Simulates the Rabin-Karp algorithm step by step and visually represents the process.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need Python and Streamlit installed on your system. You can install the required packages using the provided `requirements.txt` file.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
String-Pattern-Matcher-App.git
```
git clone https://github.com/Bit-Lords-1000101/String-Pattern-Matcher-App.git
```

2. Change to the project directory:

```
cd String-Pattern-Matcher-App
```

3. Install the requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the application:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start the Streamlit development server, and the app will open in your default web browser. You can interact with the app by entering text and patterns and clicking the "Run" or "Run Simulation" buttons.
